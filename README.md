Problem Statement:
Organizations receive thousands of customer support tickets daily, making it
challenging to categorize them manually. Misclassification delays resolution, frustrates
customers, and increases operational costs.
The task is to build a many-to-one RNN model that can automatically classify tickets
into their respective queues based on the ticket body text. After classification, we will
integrate Gemini API to automatically draft a polite and generic response for the
customer, acknowledging their issue and assuring support.
